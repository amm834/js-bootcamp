# js-bootcamp

I highly recommend this course if you are a beginner or advanced level developer.
Especially second part is pretty good and straight forward.
The instructor (Stephen Grider) teachs you a bunch of new concept and apply that into the project. If you are a beginner I don't recommend this course.
But the first part is good for both of the beginner and other level dev.
